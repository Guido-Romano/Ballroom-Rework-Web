    "title": "Showmatch Dancers vs Ballroom Dancers",
    "info": "Due to the appearance of ballroom dance on television through shows like 'Showmatch', 'Strictly Come Dancing', or 'Dancing with the Stars', ballroom has gained some popularity. However, it's important to distinguish the differences between original ballroom and the fusion of elements seen in TV shows.",
    "info2": "\n\n\n1) CHOREOGRAPHIES: Choreographies are undoubtedly the main distinctive element between TV contests and original ballroom.\n\n\nChoreographies for TV shows are primarily aimed at entertainment and spectacle. Ballroom choreographies are guided by the concept of 'elegance', often avoiding tricks and acrobatics.\n\n\nCONTEXT / ENVIRONMENT: TV contests can stage a whole show around a choreography. They can choose the theme and comfortably have one couple dancing on the floor, without the strict evaluation parameters found in competitive ballroom dancing.\n\n\nIn ballroom tournaments, dancing usually involves several couples at the same time, with no choice in music. While there are predetermined rhythms (Samba, Cha Cha Cha, Rumba, Paso Doble, Jive), dancers cannot choose the song. The music simply plays, and dancers demonstrate their interpretation ability, timing, and dance.\n\n\nIt's much less controlled; couples choreograph accordingly, considering factors like physical connection, choreography, posture and balance, movement quality, musicality, precision, and smooth transitions. However, they don't aim solely for show or attention-seeking; in fact, many times they avoid these factors to maintain the tournament's aesthetics, in other words, to preserve the pure expression of music."

    "title": "Who Wins a Ballroom Tournament?",
    "info": "The fastest?\n\n\nThe most technical?\n\n\nThe most precise?\n\n\nThe most complicated choreography?\n\n\nThe best connection?",
    "info2": "\n\n\n🟡Perhaps a balanced sum of all these factors could be an answer, where they are evenly balanced or excel in one of these qualities. This is good as it marks personal style. We all know how important it is to be unique and original in art.\n\n\nBryan Watson says the best dancer is the one who best expresses the music. Technique, tools, and skills are means to that end, but replicating choreography over and over, executing movements mechanically to perfection across all themes and rhythms, won't make you a great dancer. You must adapt your tools to best express the music.\n\n\nTherefore, choreography with different songs should look different (musically at least). If they all look the same, you're like a 100-meter sprinter who just runs flat out as soon as the bell rings, giving everything physically possible. Perfect, you're a great athlete, but you're not really dancing. And I say you're not really dancing because there's no listening, interpretation, or expression of what the music evokes. Here in dance, we must also consider that it's largely art, and as Bruce said, art is not just embellishment or ornamentation; it's also expression.\n\n\nWho do you think should win a competition?"

    "info": "In the initial stages of Ballroom Latin, where a dancer starts with the basics such as figure names, timing for each rhythm, and ballroom fundamentals, it's important to consider the following concepts:",
    "info2": "1. Clear Figures: Clear distinction should be made between a figure, its transition, and the subsequent figure.\n\n\n2. Precise Timing: Fundamental and critical criterion for evaluating a couple and demonstrating understanding of the musical composition.\n\n\n3. Correct Posture: Essential for presenting the dancer both individually and as a couple, conveying presence to the audience, clarity in movements, and distinct characterization of each rhythm."

In our classes, we will assign you a partner to practice with.\n\n\nWhat clothing and footwear should I wear for classes?\n\n\nIt's recommended to wear comfortable clothing that allows freedom of movement and suitable footwear for dancing, preferably with leather or similar soles.\n\n\nHow often should I take classes to improve?\n\n\nThe ideal frequency varies based on your goals and availability. However, we recommend at least twice a week for steady progress."
