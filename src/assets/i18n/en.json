      "info": "A raíz de la aparición del ballroom en televisión de la mano de programas como \"Showmatch\", \"Strictly Come Dancing\" o \"Dancing with the Stars\", el ballroom ha logrado tener cierta llegada al público. Sin embargo, es importante distinguir las diferencias entre el ballroom original y la fusión de elementos que se ven en los shows televisivos.",
      "info2": "\n\n\n1) COREOGRAFÍAS: Las coreografías son sin duda el principal elemento distintivo entre los concursos televisivos y el ballroom original.\n\n\nLas coreografías hechas para los programas, tienen como finalidad principal el show y el espectáculo. Las coreografías de ballroom tienen como directriz subyacente el concepto de \"elegancia\", lo que suele derivar en prescindir de trucos y acrobacias.\n\n\nCONTEXTO / AMBIENTE: En los concursos televisivos se puede preparar todo un show alrededor de una coreografía. Se permite tanto elegir el tema y la comodidad de bailar una sola pareja en la pista, sumado a que no se encuentran los parámetros de evaluación por los cuales son evaluadas las parejas en competición.\n\n\nEn los torneos de ballroom, se suele bailar con varias parejas al mismo tiempo, no se puede elegir la canción o música. Si bien hay un orden de ritmos predeterminados (Samba, Cha Cha Cha, Rumba, Paso Doble, Jive) no se puede elegir el tema a bailar. Simplemente la música suena, los bailarines demuestran su capacidad de interpretación, escucha de tiempos y bailan.\n\n\nEs mucho menos controlado, las parejas tienen coreografías acordes a este factor y también teniendo en cuenta que son evaluadas por: conexión física, coreografía, postura y balance, calidad de los movimientos, musicalidad, precisión, fluidez en las transiciones. Pero no buscan el puro show o llamar la atención, de hecho, muchas veces se prescinden de esos factores porque rompe con la estética de los torneos, en otras palabras, \"ensucian\" la expresión de la música."

      "info": "¿Los más rápidos?\n\n\n¿Los más técnicos?\n\n\n¿Los más precisos?\n\n\n¿La coreografía más complicada?\n\n\n¿La mejor conexión?",
      "info2": "\n\n\n🟡Puede que una suma balanceada de todos estos factores sea una respuesta, incluso puede que estén balanceados en todo esto y sobresalgan en una de estas cualidades, lo que es bueno ya que da la marca personal. Y todos sabemos lo importante que es ser único y original en el arte.\n\n\nBryan Watson dice que el mejor bailarín es quien mejor expresa la música. La técnica, las herramientas y habilidades son herramientas para ello, pero no replicar constantemente la coreografía una y otra vez, ejecutando la mecánica de los movimientos a la perfección, infinitas veces en todos los temas de todos los ritmos de la misma manera, eso no te hará un gran bailarín. Debes adecuar tus herramientas para expresar de la mejor forma posible la música.\n\n\nPor lo tanto, la coreografía con distintas canciones debe verse diferente (musicalmente por lo menos). Si se ven todas iguales, eres como un atleta de 100 metros llanos, que apenas suena la campana sale corriendo y dando lo máximo físicamente que puede entregar su cuerpo. Perfecto, eres un gran atleta, pero no estás realmente bailando. Y digo que no estás realmente bailando porque no hay una escucha, una interpretación y una expresión de lo que la música te genera. Y aquí en danza hay que tener en cuenta que también y en gran parte es arte, y como dijo Bruce, el arte no solo es embellecimiento u ornamento, también es expresión.\n\n\n¿Y tú qué pareja crees que debe ganar una competencia?"

      "info": "En las etapas iniciales de Ballroom Latin, donde un bailarín/na empieza con su alfabetización en cuanto al nombre de las figuras, los tiempos de cada ritmo, los fundamentos del ballroom, conviene tener en cuenta los siguientes conceptos:",
      "info2": "1. Figuras claras: Debe quedar clara la distinción entre una figura, la transición y la figura que le continúa.\n\n\n2. Tiempos precisos: Criterio fundamental y crítico tanto a la hora de evaluar una pareja, como también para demostrar que se entiende el lenguaje por el que está compuesta la música.\n\n\n3. Postura correcta: Fundamental tanto a la hora de la presentación del bailarín, tanto individual como en pareja, ya que transmite entre otras cosas, la presencia hacia el público, la claridad de los movimientos, la distinción y caracterización de cada ritmo."

Sin embargo, recomendamos al menos dos veces a la semana para un progreso constante."
