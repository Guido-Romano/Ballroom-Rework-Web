I remember the day I first walked through the doors of the branch on Avenida Corrientes and met the two teachers who left an indelible mark on my formation: Mery Lenz and Eugenio Dmytrenko. From that moment on, I knew I wanted to absorb every teaching these dance virtuosos had to offer.\n\nOver the years, I have participated in ballroom competitions, excelling in letter and Open categories, achieving first places, and becoming a finalist on multiple occasions. I have shared my knowledge through group and private classes in various provinces of Argentina, from Buenos Aires to Santa Fe, from beginner to advanced levels.\n\nHowever, the year 2024 marks a new chapter in my journey, as I have decided to embark on my own personal project: BASC. My goal with BASC is clear: to spread ballroom dances, to transmit my love for this dance, and to support, train, and accompany all those who wish to delve into this exciting world.\n\nTherefore, I invite everyone to join me on this journey of learning and discovery. I await you with open arms to learn to dance and to share this thrilling path together!"

Precise timing: Fundamental and critical criteria both for evaluating a couple and for demonstrating an understanding of the language by which the music is composed.\n\n3.

      "info": "As a result of the appearance of ballroom dancing on television through programs like 'Showmatch'' 'Strictly Come Dancing' or 'Dancing with the Stars' ballroom dancing has managed to reach a certain audience. However, it is important to distinguish the differences between original ballroom dancing and the fusion of elements seen in television shows.",
      "info2": "1) CHOREOGRAPHY: Choreography is undoubtedly the main distinctive element between televised contests and original ballroom dancing.\n\nChoreographies made for TV shows are primarily intended for show and spectacle. Ballroom choreographies are guided by the underlying concept of 'elegance' which often leads to dispensing with tricks and acrobatics.\n\nCONTEXT/SETTING: In televised contests, an entire show can be prepared around a choreography. It is allowed to choose both the theme and the comfort of dancing with only one couple on the dance floor, in addition to not meeting the evaluation parameters by which couples in competition are judged.\n\nIn ballroom tournaments, it is common to dance with several couples at the same time; you cannot choose the song or music. Although there is a predetermined order of rhythms (Samba, Cha Cha Cha, Rumba, Paso Doble, Jive), you cannot choose the theme to dance. Simply put, the music plays, the dancers demonstrate their ability to interpret, listen to beats, and dance.\n\nIt is much less controlled; couples have choreographies according to this factor and also taking into account that they are evaluated for: physical connection, choreography, posture and balance, quality of movements, musicality, precision, fluidity in transitions. But they do not seek pure show or attention-seeking, in fact, they often dispense with those factors because it disrupts the aesthetics of tournaments, in other words, it 'dirties' the expression of the music."

        "info": "The fastest?\n\nThe most technical?\n\nThe most precise?\n\nThe most complicated choreography?\n\nThe best connection?",
        "info2": "🟡Perhaps a balanced sum of all these factors is an answer, or maybe they're balanced in all these and excel in one of these qualities, which is good as it gives personal branding. And we all know how important it is to be unique and original in art.\n\nBryan Watson says the best dancer is the one who best expresses the music. Technique, tools, and skills are tools for this, but constantly replicating the choreography over and over again, executing the mechanics of the movements perfectly, countless times in all themes of all rhythms in the same way, that won't make you a great dancer. You must adapt your tools to express the music in the best possible way.\n\nTherefore, the choreography with different songs should look different (musically at least). If they all look the same, you're like a 100-meter sprinter, who barely hears the bell and starts running, giving his body the maximum physically possible. Perfect, you're a great athlete, but you're not really dancing. And I say you're not really dancing because there's no listening, interpretation, and expression of what the music generates in you. And here in dance, it must also be taken into account that it is largely art, and as Bruce said, art is not only embellishment or ornament, it is also expression.\n\nAnd what couple do you think should win a competition?"
